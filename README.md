In addition, there is an option to filter the results by cuisine, diet or intolerances (before searching), and sort the results by popularity or making time.

Discover new recipes - when a user opens the home page, he can see a list of a 3 random recipes which can be changed by clicking the "Random" button.

Add a recipe to the favorites list - There are two ways to add a recipe to the account's favorites list:
